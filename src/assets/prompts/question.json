The inner monologue should be written with a critical tone and be short. \nThe continuation should have the following format: '<inner monologue>, thought <name of the main character>.'. \nGive the inner monologue within single quotes. \n\nAvoid purple prose AT ALL COSTS. \nAvoid paraphrasing parts of the story. \n\nFormat each question as a JSON object with 'question' and 'continuation' as the keys. \nFormat your response as a JSON object with 'Q1', 'Q2' and 'Q3' as the keys. \n\nStory: ```::full::```",
